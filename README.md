# Stock-Predictor
The Stock Predictor is implemented using the concepts of RNN(Recurrent Neural Network) - LSTM(Long Short Term Memory). We only store key words or important words in long term memory and discard all the other words and this is determined by training data , after training the model knows how to store the keywords in long term memory which helps in predicting the next sequence. <br>
First import all the libraries. Load the data and convert it's datatype if needed. The data is then pre-processed using the training dataset. Transform the dataset using scaling. Create a data structure with 60 timestamps and 1 output. Build the RNN LSTM model using Keras libraries. Use regression and train the neural network. Predictions are made using the test dataset. Then visualize the data and then we get the prediction model.
